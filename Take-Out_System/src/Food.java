/**This class represents a Food class in a Takeout System. It represents the

 *  and price. The name field represents the name of the food, the
 *  description is referred to as the category or description of food and the
 *  price refers to the current price of the food. Instead of using getters
 *  and setters in the class, this is defined in a separate Interface called
 *  PricedItem. This is in the event that another item, which is not food,
 *  that is to be sold by the Takeout System is added, all that is needed is
 *  to implement the interface.
