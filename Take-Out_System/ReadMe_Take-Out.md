**Project Goals**

This package, Takeout System, simulates a takeout system in a restaurant environment. It uses basic Java and 
Programming  principles and frameworks to create a logic of a customer ordering and checking out from a 
restaurant. TakeoutSystem contains folders which represents various classes that simulate real life 
conditions of things and people in restaurant. It also contains test folders to test written code.

Context: Using the collections framework, generics, and the knowledge of Java, I create a take-out system. I define classes, interfaces, and methods (generic and non-generic) needed to represent our system and perform our take-out logic with the help of Java collections.

**Objects Include**:\
Customer: Represents a customer object and simulates the process of a real customer\
Food: Represents a food object and simulates various food that the restaurant would offer to sell to customers\
Menu: Represents a menu object and simulates menu of various foods presented to customer\
ShoppingBag: Represents a cart or checkout process of customer in restaurant.\
TakeOutSimulator: This class represents all the functionality of an actual takeout system. This is called by   driver or main to allow for a neater code
