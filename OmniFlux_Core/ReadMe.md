## Omniflux Core
## Project Overview
This project revolves around creating a set of functions to manipulate the instructions of a hypothetical and simplistic processor called the Omniflux Core. The Omniflux Core is a processor with a small set of instructions and a small memory use.

It's no supercomputer, more like the sort of thing you'd find in a toaster or other basic appliances. Even though it's not complex, it's a fantastic way to understand the basics of how a processor works.

## Objectives
Here's the rundown of what this project involves:

- Instruction Manipulation: The Omniflux Core has its own unique instruction set. My task? Craft functions to manipulate these instructions - kind of like giving this basic processor a few extra skills.

- Memory Management: The Omniflux Core doesn't have a ton of memory to play with, so part of the challenge here was working within those limitations and optimizing memory usage.

- Hardware and Assembly Language Concepts: This project offered a great opportunity to dive into some hardware and assembly language concepts. It's like peering behind the curtain to see how the magic happens in the computing world.

- C Programming: This project was done in C, which has some powerful features such as bit operators and arrays that are super useful when you're working with low-level computing concepts like this.

- It was a challenge, but the kind that makes you scratch your head and then feel pretty awesome when you figure it out. By the end, I had a stronger understanding of low-level computing and a greater appreciation for the intricacies of computer systems. If you're interested, you're more than welcome to take a look at the code and see how it all came together. Enjoy!
