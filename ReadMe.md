# Coffee Machine Simulator

## Project Overview

This project simulates the operations of a basic coffee machine, capable of preparing different coffee variants like espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Through this project, users can interact with the simulator to select beverages, refill machine resources, check remaining supplies, and collect the machine's cash.

The Coffee Machine Simulator not only brews virtual coffee but offers a foundational understanding of Java's object-oriented programming, user input handling, and conditional logic. The project was sourced from Hyperskill

### Features

- Coffee Selection: `Choose from three delicious coffee variants - espresso, latte, or cappuccino. Each variant has its unique recipe and resource requirement.`

- Resource Management: `Monitor and manage your machine's resources. Ensure it's always stocked with water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups to serve the next coffee craving.`

- Cash Collection: `After each coffee sale, the machine accumulates cash. At any time, users can collect this money.`

- Check Supplies: `Get a quick snapshot of the machine's current resources and cash. Always stay informed.`

- Interactive Interface: `With simple prompts and easy-to-understand instructions, operating the Coffee Machine Simulator feels almost like the real deal!`

### Behind the Code

- Enums in Action: `The program  uses Java's Enum construct to represent each coffee variant's resource requirement, ensuring code clarity and easy modification.`

- User Input Handling: `Using Java's Scanner class, the program efficiently captures user input for various operations.`

- String Manipulation: `The project employs StringBuilder to format the resource summary, showcasing effective string management in Java.`

- Conditional Logic: `Based on available resources and user selections, the machine decides if it can brew a coffee or if it needs more supplies. The program uses a series of conditional statements to make these decisions.`

### Getting Started

- Prerequisites: `Ensure you have Java SDK installed on your machine.`
- Running the Simulator: `Navigate to the directory containing the CoffeeMachine.java file. Compile the program using javac CoffeeMachine.java and then run the simulator with java CoffeeMachine.`
