## Welcome to my Portfolio*

### Description
This repository contains my experience and understanding of programming, brought to life through various projects. I use different languages to help me understand proper implementation of coding syntax and concepts.
Implementation of these projects might definitely be improved on in better ways, but each project simply represents how well I understand and can logically solve a problem. Therefore my understanding and experience might lack in some and be better in others.

_Projects include_: 

- A Takeout System: `This simulates real life application of takeout systems that can used by restaurant to take a customer's order. This program is written in java and creates different functionality of a customer ordering food. It simulates the process of a customer in a restaurant from start to finish. Refer to ReadMe_Take-out in Take-Out System for more information`

- Omniflux Core processor: `This dives into the realm of low-level computing, manipulating instructions of a simple processor called the Omniflux Core. This program is in C, and the project shows efficient memory management, hardware understanding, and assembly language concepts. It provides a comprehensive simulation of how such a processor, despite its limited resources, operates in basic appliances. Refer to the README file in the Omniflux Core Project folder for more information.`

-  Word Count Program: `This program counts the number of words, lines, and characters in the files whose names are given as command-line arguments. It uses C to build a multi-threaded version of a simple word count tool, similar to the Unix wc command. For more details, please refer to the ReadMe_WC file in the Word Count folder.`
