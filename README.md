# Welcome to my Portfolio

This repository contains my experience and understanding of programming, brought to life through various projects. I use different languages to help me understand proper implementation of coding syntax and concepts.
Implementation of these projects might definitely be improved on in better ways, but each project simply represents how well I understand and can logically solve a problem. Therefore my understanding and experience might lack in some and be better in others.

Projects include: 

A Takeout System: This simulates real life application of takeout systems that can used by restaurant to take customer's order. 
									
	This project is written in Java. Please refer to TakeoutSystem in src for more information.
