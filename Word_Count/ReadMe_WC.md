# Word Count
## Project Goals
This package, Multithreaded Word Count Utility, emulates a simple UNIX word count utility (wc). The unique feature of this package is its multithreaded functionality. It uses basic C programming principles and pthreads to concurrently process multiple text files. Multithreaded Word Count Utility contains code snippets that represent various classes that simulate real-life file reading and counting conditions. It also expects test cases to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the written code.

## Context
Using the pthreads library and the knowledge of C programming, I pretty much implement word count utility. This is done by defining functions and methods needed to represent our system and perform our concurrent file processing logic with the help of threads in C. In the C language, I use threads to make the word count program run faster. I also create separate threads to read each file and count the number of lines, words, and characters.

## Components include:

- Thread: Represents a thread object and simulates the process of a real thread running and performing tasks concurrently.

This project is all about learning how to use threads in C with Pthreads and making a program run faster by doing multiple things at once
